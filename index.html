            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In an era increasingly focused on sustainability and environmental responsibility, the scrap metal industry has emerged as a crucial player in the global recycling ecosystem. Scrap metal recycling not only conserves natural resources but also reduces energy consumption and minimizes landfill waste. The prices of scrap metal, however, are subject to constant fluctuations influenced by a variety of factors including market demand, material type, global economic conditions, and technological advancements. This guide delves into scrap metal pricing, exploring factors, market trends, and selling strategies.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">1. Overview of Scrap Metal</h2>

            <h3>1.1 What is Scrap Metal?</h3>
            <p>Scrap metal refers to metal waste that can be recycled and reused. It encompasses a wide range of materials, from industrial by-products to discarded consumer goods. Recycling scrap metal is not only environmentally beneficial but also economically viable.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Categories of Scrap Metal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ferrous Metals:</strong> Contain iron and are magnetic. Common ferrous metals include steel and iron.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Ferrous Metals:</strong> Do not contain iron and are generally more valuable. Examples include aluminum, copper, brass, and stainless steel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="factors">2. Factors Influencing Scrap Metal Prices</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Global Market Trends</h3>
